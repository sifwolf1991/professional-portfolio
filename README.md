## 1. Description

The website design aims to be:

+ Structured: the webpage layout is structured by different elements, such as a header, sidebar/aside, different sections, images, footer, and borders. 

+ Biographical: Providing a bio section, recent photo of me, informational sections about me, and links to my work and contact details

+ Navigational: Provides various links which guide the user to the corresponding sections of the page

+ Interactive: A Work section provides links to my deployed applications

+ Responsive: Uses media enquiries and viewport to create a responsible layout which adapts to the user's window or device size. Information has been put inside flexboxes to allow resizing of elements if the window is minimized.

## 2. Installation 
The website has been deployed over GitHub and is viewable through a web browser. The HTML and CSS code can be run through a code editor such as Visual Code Studio and previewed in a Live Server window.

## 3. Usage   

This website serves to promote my profile as a future graduate of coding bootcamp, and a way to introduce myself and show samples of my current work for employers to review and assess for potential employment. This also serves as a record of my current coding knowledge and skillset.

It includes sections such as an introduction and bio, samples of my previous work, and contact information with links.
